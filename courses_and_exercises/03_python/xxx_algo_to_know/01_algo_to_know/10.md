# Dictionary and Function Exercise

Create a program to manage employee prime (bonus) eligibility based on their seniority and salary.

1. Create a dictionary structure:
   - Create a dictionary named `people` containing employee information
   - Each employee should have: name, seniority (in years), and salary (in euros)
   - Add at least two employees with different profiles

2. Create an eligibility checking function:
   - Name the function `is_eligible_for_prime`
   - Parameters: name (str), seniority (int), salary (int)
   - Return type: boolean
   - Define the following thresholds:
     * Seniority: 5 years and 10 years
     * Salary: 1500€ and 2300€

3. Implement the eligibility rules:
   - An employee is eligible if they meet one of these conditions:
     * Junior (< 5 years) with low salary (< 1500€)
     * Mid-level (5-10 years) with medium salary (1500€-2300€)
     * Senior (> 10 years) with either low (< 1500€) or high (> 2300€) salary

4. Create a function to process all employees:
   - Name the function `check_prime_eligibility`
   - Parameter: dictionary of employees
   - For each employee, check their eligibility
   - Display a formatted message showing:
     * Employee name
     * Eligibility status
     * Current salary
     * Years of seniority

5. Test your implementation:
   - Print the structure of your dictionary using `.items()` and `.values()`
   - Run the eligibility check for all employees

```python
people = {
    "bernadette" : {
        "name" : "Bernadette",
        "seniority" : 12,
        "salary" : 2400,
    },
    "marc" : {
        "name" : "Marc",
        "seniority" : 6,
        "salary" : 1490,
    },
}


print(people["bernadette"].items())
print(people["marc"].values())
print(people.items())
