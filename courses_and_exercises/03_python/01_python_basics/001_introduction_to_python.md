<h2 id="what_is_python">What is Python?</h2>

Python is a **programming language**:

* **Imperative**: a program consists of a sequence of predefined instructions that allow the execution of actions (writing, entering input, performing a calculation, reading a file, etc.);

* **Structured**: the execution of a program is not strictly sequential; control structures allow a sequence of instructions to be repeated in loops or executed only under certain conditions;

* **Low-level**: it handles access to memory, calculations within the microprocessor, and input-output operations;

* **Modular**: it has many libraries that can be loaded to perform more specific instructions;

* **Object-oriented**: it allows object-oriented programming, a more advanced concept that will not be covered this year.

It also has many qualities:

* its syntax is very simple and concise: "you code as you think," making it easy to learn, close to an "algorithmic language";

* **modern**: relatively recent, it is currently the most widely used programming language. It is widely used in industry, education, and research, particularly for scientific applications;

* **free**: available on most platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). A large community contributes to its development.


<h2 id="why">Why Use Python?</h2>


There are lots of good reasons to choose Python 

- Clear and readable syntax

    - Code like for i in range(5): print(i) is straightforward and easy to understand, even without experience.

- Fewer lines of code

    - Many tasks require much less code than in Java or C++. That means you can move faster and stay focused on solving real problems.

- Huge community and support

    - If you get stuck, help is everywhere: tutorials, Stack Overflow, GitHub projects, and official documentation.

- Used in almost every industry

    - Web scraping, finance, AI, automation, education, video games, science — Python adapts to any field.

- Powerful libraries ready to use

    - Need to call an API? Try requests. Analyze data? Use pandas. Make plots? There’s matplotlib.

**Example:**

- A **small startup** can build everything in Python 
    - backend server, data processing pipeline, and even a machine learning model 
    - all in one language.



<h2 id="good_at">What Is Python Really Good At?</h2>

Python shines in many areas thanks to its flexible design and rich ecosystem:

- Data Science

    - Use pandas, numpy, matplotlib, or scipy to manipulate and visualize data easily.

- Machine Learning

    - Train models with scikit-learn, build neural networks with tensorflow, keras, or pytorch.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    - Libraries like nltk and spaCy let you analyze or generate text in just a few lines of code.

- Web Development

    - Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build websites, APIs, and dashboards.

- Automation and Scripting

    - Python is great for automating repetitive tasks 
    - renaming files, cleaning spreadsheets, scraping data from websites, etc.

- IoT and Embedded Systems

    - You can even control a Raspberry Pi and sensors with Python scripts.

**Example:**

- NASA uses Python to automate the analysis of satellite data 
    - saving both time and manual effort.
