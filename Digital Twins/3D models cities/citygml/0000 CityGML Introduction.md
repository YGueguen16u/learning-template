# CityGML Introduction

CityGML is an open conceptual data model for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. 

It is defined through a Unified Modeling Language (UML) object model. This UML model extends the ISO Technical Committee 211 (TC211) conceptual model standards for spatial and temporal data. 

Building on the ISO foundation assures that the man-made features described in the City Models share the same spatial-temporal universe as the surrounding countryside within which they reside. 

The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields.

Cities and companies are building virtual 3D city models for :
- urban planning
- mobile telecommunication
- disaster management
- 3D cadastre
- tourism
- vehicle and pedestrian navigation
- facility management
- environmental simulations

In the implementation of the European Environmental Noise Directive (END, 2002/49/EC) 3D geoinformation and 3D city models play an important role.


CityGML defines the classes and relations for the most relevant topographic objects in cities and regional models with respect to their :
- geometrical properties
- topological properties
- semantical properties
- appearance properties

“City” is broadly defined to comprise built : 
- structures, 
- elevation, 
- vegetation, 
- water bodies, 
- “city furniture”, 
- ...

Included are generalization hierarchies between thematic classes, aggregations, relations between objects, and spatial properties. 

CityGML is applicable for 
- large areas 
- small regions 

It can represent the terrain and 3D objects in different levels of detail simultaneously. 

CityGML enables lossless information exchange between different GI systems and users. It can be used to represent 
- single scale models without topology and few semantics 
- very complex multi-scale models with full topology and fine-grained semantical differentiations
